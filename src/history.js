//*this file in unnecessary, but if you have problem with pushing in history with react router dom you can make custom history like this and use it in app

//this package is automatically given by react router dom...
//i created this separate history component so that i can have access to history in non react components also...

// const createHistory = require("history").createBrowserHistory;

// export default createHistory();

// import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

// export default useHistory();
